# Yerrr! I'm Ricardo 👋🏾

I design intelligent systems at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and quantum technologies.
My work is rooted in systems thinking and driven by cross-domain innovation—transforming complex research into scalable,
real-world solutions.

## About Me

    """Full-Stack AI Engineer | Multi-Agent Systems | Knowledge Graphs | Quantum Computing"""
    
    stack = {
        "AI": ["LangGraph Multi-Agent", "Graph RAG", "Vector Search", "AWS Bedrock"],
        "Data": ["Neo4j + GDS", "MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", "Graph ML"],
        "Languages": ["Python", "Rust", "Go", "TypeScript", "Solidity"],
        "Blockchain": ["Hyperledger Besu", "Smart Contracts", "Web3", "EVM"],
        "Infra": ["AWS", "Kubernetes", "Docker", "CUDA/ROCm"],
        "Quantum": ["IBM Qiskit Certified", "VQE/QAOA", "127-qubit"]
    }
    
    certifications = ["Deloitte AI", "IBM Quantum", "NVIDIA Supercomputer"]
```

## Current Focus

- **Semantic Code Intelligence** - Building tools for navigating AI-generated codebases through concept-based search
- **Supervisor Multi-agent Systems** - Coordinating specialized AI agents with LangGraph + Neo4j/MongoDB/ChromaDB backends
- **Self-hosted LLM Infrastructure** - Running private, scalable AI systems on local dedicated hardware

## Featured Projects

- **[semantic-code-mcp](https://github.com/Ricoledan/semantic-code-mcp)** - MCP server for semantic code search using AST-aware chunking and vector embeddings
- **[supervisor-multi-agent-system](https://github.com/Ricoledan/supervisor-multi-agent-system)** - Multi-agent architecture with central supervisor and specialized workers
- **[bmad-architecture-agent](https://github.com/Ricoledan/bmad-architecture-agent)** - Expert architect toolkit for the BMAD-METHOD framework
