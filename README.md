# Yerrr! I'm Ricardo 👋🏾

I design intelligent systems at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and quantum technologies.
My work is rooted in systems thinking and driven by cross-domain innovation—transforming complex research into scalable,
real-world solutions.

```

## Current Focus

- **Distributed AI Infrastructure** - Building self-hosted agent frameworks for orchestrating AI workloads across heterogeneous hardware
- **Semantic Code Intelligence** - Reducing AI assistant token usage by 67% through concept-based code search
- **Supervisor Multi-agent Systems** - Coordinating specialized AI agents with LangGraph + Neo4j/MongoDB/ChromaDB backends
